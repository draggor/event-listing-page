# Artist/Dealer/Vendor Listing Page
This is a react SPA that starts by showing off a random list of your vendors, while also allowing search, a-z and z-a sorting, as well as filtering by categories.  All of this is generated from a spreadsheet, and can be easily deployed to netlify.

# Under Construction!
As of right now this repo is hardcoded with data for Anthrocon Online 2021, as well as having some data from Fur Squared Online 2021.  Either this repo will get cleaned up, or a fresh one that is generic with proper instructions will appear.

For now, want a feature?  Found a bug?  Use github's issues!
